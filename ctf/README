# MiniCTF Template

This template is designed to guide you in developing and submitting MiniCTF
challenges.

## Directory Structure and Contents

* meta/: Challenge metadata
  * title: Title of your challenge (use only printable characters)
  * desc: Challenge description. You can include hints or references
  * authors: Student ids and full names of all team members
  * flag: Flag string. Must be in format: CSED702C{something}

* src/: Source code, build script, and exploit
  * target.c: Challenge source code
  * Makefile: Build script for compiling the challenge
  * exploit.py: Exploit script
  * writeup.txt: Detailed write-up of your solution

* release/: Everything in this folder will be published to the CTF server
  * By default, `desc`, `flag`, and `target` will be included
  * Permissions will be set such that `flag` is only accessible through the
    shell spawned by `target`
  * If you want to release both source and binary, copy both `target.c` and
    `target` into this directory.

## Building and Testing
* Modify `Makefile` to specify desired compilation flags (`CFLAGS += ...`)
* Compile `target.c` on our CTF server by running `make` under a tmp directory
* Verify that the compiled `target` runs without errors
* Your `exploit.py` should successfully spawn a shell or print the contents of
  `flag` when run against the compiled `target`

## Submission
Compress the entire directory as `chal_title.zip` and submit to PLMS. Only one
submission per team is needed - does not matter who submits.
